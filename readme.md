# Features
Here is what you get from this Watchface:

* Low battery usage - this face is very efficient and your battery will go further.

* WolfPack Logo front and center operates as a battery indicator and generally makes you look cool - over 90% full it is green meaning, fully charged.  Over 50% it's white meaning "no need to charge".  Over 30% it's orange meaning "might as well charge".  Under 30% it's red meaning "you won't get a long run from it".

* Messages at training dates.  These default to the Wolfpack training times but are customizable in the settings on Garmin Connect to whenever you train regularly.  The messages come on 2 hours before the indicated hour and go off afterwards.  Change the default messages to anything you like "You love to see it", "Strides before ..", etc.
